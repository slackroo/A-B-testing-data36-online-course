Data science courses have taken the internet with even a small search on google with data as the keyword.

I have gone through a lot of iterations to find and plot the valuable links that could make promotion of paid course content. This was set up to identify if a pop up on a page would increase subscribers or take up a paid course. SQL article click through data is not captured and analysis is directed at the top most content clicked through.

Findings from data really help promoters find the direction where a positive outcome can justify a valuable spend on monetary resources
